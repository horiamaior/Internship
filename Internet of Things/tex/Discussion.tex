\section{Discussion, Conclusion Further Work}
In Section \ref{intro} we described our interest and motivation for the paper. We also presented an overview of the framework specification we were to present and pointed out strengths and weaknesses of our approach. In the further section, Section \ref{problem}, we have described a mathematical model of the IoT, we developed four algorithms for the model, and in the last part, we developed a proof of correctness for main properties of the model/framework.

The present work has attempted to describe a framework for a real time resource-constrained problem. However, dealing with a complex system (IoT), we made a series of assumptions attempting to simplify it.

Further work in this area of research can explore issues that have not been considered in this paper, including: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item having objects that can change their power demands in time (e.g. thinking of a hairdryer machine, normally has few levels of power),
    \item explore what happens when the power supplier is varying the available power resource,
    \item and nonetheless, creating applying the framework in real life with the help of simulation.
\end{itemize}
