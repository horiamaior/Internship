	1 System model
	 abstraction of a real system ... capturing the property of the system 
	 question : what are the relevant properties of the system (component ) properties
	 things that communicate 
	 local computing connection
	 
	 
	2 Algorithms
	3 Math results (proofs of correctness and performance analysis)
	
II Application
	1 Simulation with real data
	2 (probably not) Experiments
